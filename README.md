# HoopGrid
HoopGrid is a fast, Tenable-style NBA trivia game where players type answers to fill a grid of prompts (e.g., “Top 10 rebounders on the ’96 Bulls”). Built to minimize name-entry errors with autocomplete + canonical player IDs, and designed to scale into a broader arcade of stats-driven sports games over time.
